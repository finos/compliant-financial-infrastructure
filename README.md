# Compliant Financial Infrastructure
Compliant Financial Infrastructure (CFI) accelerates the development, deployment and adoption of services provided for _AWS_, _Azure_, _Google Cloud_, and _IBM Cloud_ in a way that meets existing regulatory and internal security controls.

## Business Problem and Opportunity
Cloud services controls and tests are used to demonstrate adherence with regulatory and internal compliance requirements mandated for financial institutions when using cloud services. The majority of cloud security incidents are due to misconfiguration; services are not secure by default, configuration is often complex, nuanced and difficult to validate. To some degree or another all financial institutions are re-inventing the wheel â€“ institutions have similar control frameworks and each is trying to secure and stand up the same providers and services within the same regulatory frameworks.

Having robust controls and tests developed and in place removes a barrier to faster adoption of cloud services such as those provided by Amazon/AWS, Microsoft/Azure and Google/GCP, among others. Addressing this barrier will benefit both financial services IT departments, many of whom are looking to move more quickly to the cloud, and the providers themselves, who wish to sell more cloud services into financial institutions.

Controls for cloud service compliance afford banks no particular strategic or competitive advantage while also representing a task something all banks who look to deploy more applications onto the cloud needs to do, and as such are conducive to being developed together as part of the "public commons". The focused project and collaboration with other banks will increase the amount of controls produced and, it's expected, help increase the rate of adoption of cloud services.

## Approach and Proposed Solution

This FINOS project produces multiple artifacts for each CFI service.
Where necessary, we have segmented the aforementioned artifacts across multiple repositories
to ensure that they are ready for quick and easy adoption by users in highly regulated environments.

1. Detailed documentation in the form of a _Service Approval Accelerator_ (SAA)
    - All SAAs live within this repository
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that meets the specifications described in the SAA
    - This IaC may include multiple services if necessary to properly ensure compliance of the specified service
    - IaC registry-ready repos should be linked as git submodules within this repository
1. Post-Deployment Validation Tests to ensure that IaC is compliant
    - Test packs for each service should live in separate repos so they can be used independently of the provided IaC
1. An automated pipeline to execute the post-deployment tests and apply accurate badges to the service
    - CI pipelines should exist in this repo to tie together all other elements

Continue reading the following section, _Feature Matrix_,
for more information about the current status of CFI services.

## Feature Matrix

CFI provides multiple services, across multiple clouds. 
These services range from not-yet-implemented, to fully featured,
and automatically tested for compliance with the CDMC framework.

This feature matrix is intended to show all current and planned services along with the current status of each,
to help contributors looking for a task know where best to spend their effort.

### Key

- :gem: diamond - Post-deployment validation tests exist for every aspect of the SAA,
and all tests pass in the CI pipeline testing phase.
- :trophy: gold - Post-deployment validation tests are run in CI as part of the testing phase,
and some tests pass.
- :cd: silver - The service is automatically spun up and destroyed via CI before being merged to `main`.
- :cookie: bronze - IaC has been produced that is able to create and destroy the service,
where said service meets the SAA specification.
- :page_facing_up: paper - A complete SAA document for this service has been merged to `main`.

## Service Approval Accelerator

The [Service Approval Accelerator](templates/ServiceApprovalAcceleratorTemplate.md) (SAA) describes each service contributed to Compliant Financial Infrastructure alongside test cases and infrastructure as code.

A single SAA should be contributed with every service contributed to Compliant Financial Infrastructure. 

You may review existing services for examples of existing SAAs.
