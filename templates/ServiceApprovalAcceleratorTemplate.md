# Detailed Security Configuration

Overview

This section is meant to provide an opinionated approach towards the
implementation security controls by domain. Although the approaches may
not be a fit for all use cases or complete for production use, they are
meant to guide the reader towards current best practices and design
considerations to achieve security control objectives.

**Controls and Architectures**

This table maps Security Domain to the corresponding controls and
architectural best practices as documented in AWS’ public documentation, 
white papers, and blog posts.

**Explanation of example below**
The content below is specific to an AWS service called RedShift.  This content is only provided with a specific service so to give examples of what content could look like.  When other cloud services are used this content would be similar to this depth and specificity but unique to the service.  The opinionated approach requires the writer to provided specific recommendations that are relevant to financial regulated industry.  The examples below are meant to provide knowledge that a person would gain through use at a production level.  The writer should provide examples of issues at scale, security challenges, example compensating controls, or limitations.  Please consider the below as a guide and format but not a template for which to replace names for services.

<td>Encryption of data at-rest</td>
<td><p>AWS RedShift supports KMS and HSM to provide key material management and encryption services. Encryption at rest of RedShift encrypts the data blocks and system metadata of the cluster and its snapshots.[1]</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Amazon Redshift selects the account service default key as the master key. The default key is an AWS-managed key that is created for your AWS account to use in Amazon Redshift. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. security controls prevent the use of default service KMS keys for sensitive workloads. Users should pre-create a customer managed CMK for RedShift usage.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> Encryption is an optional, immutable setting of a cluster. If you want encryption, you enable it during the cluster launch process. To go from an unencrypted cluster to an encrypted cluster or the other way around, unload your data from the existing cluster and reload it in a new cluster with the chosen encryption setting. [2]</p>

<td>Network Isolation</td>
<td><p>When an Amazon Redshift cluster is provisioned, it is locked down by default so nobody has access to it except to IAM entities with Console access from within the provisioned network and with the default credentials. Amazon Redshift provides a cluster security group called default, which is created automatically when you launch your first cluster. Initially, this cluster security group is empty. You can add inbound access rules to the default cluster security group and then associate it with your Amazon Redshift cluster. To grant other users inbound access to an Amazon Redshift cluster, you associate the cluster with a security group. To grant access use an existing Amazon VPC security group or define a new one and then associate it with a cluster. For more information on managing a cluster on the EC2-VPC platform, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-clusters-vpc.html">Managing Clusters in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon RedShift relies on EC2 security groups to provide infrastructure security, and thus initial protection from unauthorized traffic connecting to the cluster. [1]</p>
<p>Best Practice</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SecurityGroups should follow a naming convention for the entire account</p></li>
<li><p>The cluster leader node is the only EC2 instance that is allowed to communicate with the cluster nodes in the AWS Service Account. Ensure to enable VPC FlowLogs on the leader node ENI and capture logs from the OS to ensure only authorized access and activity has occurred.</p></li>
<li><p>For the leader node it is recommended the SecurityGroup have no outbound entries to prevent egress of data if the node is compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to reference other SecurityGroups instead of using IP</p></li>
<li><p>Enable EnhancedVPCRouting [4]</p></li>
<li><p>Enable VPCEndpoint with S3</p></li>
<li><p>For most use cases the cluster should not be publically accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure default port to authorized port for SecurityGroup usage. The default port is 5439 and cannot be changed after cluster is built.[5]</p></li>

<li><p>Ensure you separate roles that perform snapshot/restore from regular users. Remember to test this as IAM assumes deny but if a broad access role is assigned and a regular user can assume that role then they user can perform the API action.

<li><p>Become very familiar with all API actions for RedShift [6]</p></li>
<li><p>To properly manage a Service-Linked role be sure to separate the "create" and "delete" actions to unique IAM entity so access to manage data and manage the cluster are separated.</p>

<td>Authorization (AWS IAM) of corporate users via Active Directory for access to RedShift resources.</td>
<td><p>Amazon Redshift requires IAM credentials that AWS can use to authenticate your requests. Those credentials must have permissions to access AWS resources, such as an Amazon Redshift cluster.</p>
<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enable organizations with multiple employees to create and manage multiple users, groups and roles under a single AWS account. With IAM policies, companies can grant IAM users/groups/roles fine-grained control to their Amazon RedShift data while also retaining full control over everything the users do.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has setup federation with AWS accounts. Therefore, the only decision to make is what API actions are needed for roles, groups, or users within IAM [2].</p>
<p>To combine these concepts to control access to RedShift resources, a user would:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine how authentication will occur with Redshift[2]</p></li>
<li><p>Create the appropriate IAM roles [5]</p>
<p>For example, a policy to allow IAM users to request credentials for temporary access. The following policy enables the GetCredentials,  CreateCluserUser, and JoinGroup actions. The policy uses condition keys to allow the GetClusterCredentials and CreateClusterUser actions only when the AWS user ID matches "AIDIODR4TAW7CSEXAMPLE:${redshift: DbUser}@yourdomain.com". IAM access is requested for the "testdb" database only. The policy also allows users to join a group named "common_group".</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch Alarms</strong> – Watch a single metric over a time period that you specify, and perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/rs-metricscollected.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/rs-metricscollected.html</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AWS CloudTrail Log Monitoring</strong> – Share log files between accounts, monitor CloudTrail log files in real time by sending them to CloudWatch Logs, write log processing applications in Java, and validate that your log files have not changed after delivery by CloudTrail. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudtrail-logging.html">Logging Amazon RedShift API Calls By Using AWS CloudTrail</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> To access logs and data for monitoring the data must be decrypted. To decrypt logs/data a customer managed CMK must be defined. Use the same CMK created to encrypt the cluster and create a new policy to grant access only to API actions necessary for tables and actions that are authorized. For example: Use guides in reference [1] where cloudformation templates already exist and can be used to provide a prescriptive approach to collecting and monitoring logs.</p>
<p>Make note of the minimum requirements for access to the Redshift user that is required. Be cautious not to enable more than the necessary “<strong>grant select on all tables in schema pg_catalog to tamreporting</strong>” entitlement.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Audit logging to Amazon S3 is an optional, manual process. When you enable logging on your cluster, you are enabling logging to Amazon S3 only. Logging to system tables is not optional and happens automatically for the cluster.

# PCSS Control Reference Matrix – Section being developed

**Detective \[3\]**

Ensure only JPMorgan Chase & Co. key material is used for KMS CMK.

Run this:

aws kms describe-key --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

The output of the above command should have a line with “**"Origin":
"EXTERNAL".**

**Ensure Redshift clusters are encrypted**

In Cloudformation template or via api action

Run this:

aws redshift describe-clusters

The output should have the following statements be true:

KmsKeyId is not null

Encrypted = True

**Preventative**

KMS key creation is highly restricted and process to create new keys
should eliminate the risk of keys being created without exported key
material.

Cloudformation templates should be parsed during check-in for parameter
settings expected (defined in detective controls section).

**Responsive**

In the event encryption settings or key configuration are detected to be
not in expected state then a responsive action is necessary.

Automated actions can and should be developed to ensure best practice is
enforced as quickly as possible.

Until automation occurs manual steps can be taken.

With the detective control for KMS keys in place it will be possible to
just create a process to migrate clusters without encryption or
unauthorized KMS key to a new cluster with proper KMS key.
