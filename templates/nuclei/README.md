# Compliant Financial Infrastructure Nuclei Templates

This repository contains instructions and guidance for writing validators for the CFI project. 

## Introduction 

[Nuclei](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/tools/nuclei/overview) by [Project Discovery](https://projectdiscovery.io/) is a community powered vulnerability scanner and it is what we will be leveraging to build the validator templates. This repo hopes to give you all the tools needed to write your own validators using Nuclei's [`code` protocol](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/protocols/code). 

> [!NOTE]  
> Nuclei templates using `code` protocol must be signed before they can be executed. Read more [here](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/reference/template-signing)
